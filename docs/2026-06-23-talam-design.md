# Talam — Full Product Design Spec

**Date:** 2026-06-23  
**Last updated:** 2026-07-11  
**Status:** Approved — v1.6  
**Author:** Surya Prakash  
**Version:** 1.6 (Settings hub+subpages; storefront-first delivery)

**Changelog v1.7 (2026-07-11)**
- **Production domain updated:** `talam4shop.com` is now the production root domain. Root and `www` render the marketing site, `{store}.talam4shop.com` renders the tenant storefront, `{store}.talam4shop.com/admin/*` renders tenant admin, and `admin.talam4shop.com` renders super admin.
- **Local route bypass added:** `localhost:3000` renders marketing; tenant storefront previews use `/dev/store/silk`, tenant admin previews use `/dev/store/silk/admin/*`, and super admin previews use `/dev/super-admin`. `silk.localhost:3000` remains an optional production-like preview.

**Changelog v1.6 (2026-07-11)**
- **Profile editing split out of Settings:** The 2026-07-04 decision that folded everything (profile + settings) into a single `/account` page is superseded. Editing your name/phone/email is now a **separate "Edit Profile" screen**, reached only via the "Profile" row in the Account Menu dropdown — not via the Settings page. Phone number is **read-only** on Edit Profile (locked field with a lock icon + "Phone number cannot be changed" caption) since phone is the OTP login identity and isn't meant to be self-service editable.
- **`/account` becomes a dedicated Settings page:** No more Personal Information card. Content is now three accordion sections — **Addresses**, **Payment Methods**, **Notifications** — plus the existing Account (Log Out / Delete Account) block. Mobile bottom nav's "Account" tab is renamed **"Settings"** (icon swapped from a person glyph to a gear) to match; it still points at the same route.
- **Addresses & Payment Methods are now real UI, not dead links:** Both were previously placeholder rows (`href="/"`, no destination). They're now expandable sections showing actual address/card entries — Default badge, Edit/Delete, "Set as Default" for non-default entries, and a "+ Add" action (opens as a modal/bottom-sheet, not a separate page). Addresses carries a hint: *"One default address is required to place orders."*
- **"My Orders" removed from Settings:** It was a redundant entry point — Orders already has its own route and its own bottom-nav/menu presence — so the row was cut to reduce duplication.
- **Notification toggles unified:** Previously two independent, out-of-sync toggle sets existed — mobile had 2 toggles (Order Notifications, WhatsApp Updates) in one `--color-store-primary`/`#25D366` mix, desktop had 3 differently-labeled toggles (Order Updates, WhatsApp Alerts, Promotions & Offers) with a third toggle in a different color entirely. Now there's one consistent 3-toggle set — **Deals / Order Updates / Promotions** — using a single color (`--color-success`) for the "on" state everywhere. Still schema-less/inert (no backing DB field) — see the `product_categories`-adjacent gap noted in §12; wiring these to a real preference field is unscoped.
- **Account Menu dropdown gains an Orders row (mobile only):** The mobile "Account Menu (Signed In)" dropdown is now Identity header → **Profile → Orders → Settings** → Log Out (4 action rows instead of 2). The **desktop** dropdown intentionally stays at 2 action rows (Profile, Settings) — Orders is reachable from the header's own Orders/cart affordance on desktop, so no Orders row was added there. This mobile/desktop asymmetry is deliberate, not an oversight.
- Route/nav updates to §3.2 below.
- **Implementation order changed to storefront-first:** complete the tenant-facing storefront through the local `/dev/store/silk` preview routes first — `/`, `/category/[categorySlug]`, `/product/[slug]`, `/about`, `/cart`, `/checkout`, `/wishlist`, `/account`, `/auth` — using the seeded dev-tenant fallback already noted below. Do not block storefront delivery on wildcard subdomain routing, custom-domain purchase, or proxy setup.
- **Tenant domain + proxy work explicitly deferred:** wildcard DNS and final production cutover remain launch-phase tasks, but host-aware proxy routing and local preview aliases are now implemented for development and pre-production verification.

**Changelog v1.5 (2026-07-09)**
- **`/shop` is now the tenant default/home route — literally, not via redirect:** The hero-driven storefront home (`HeroBanner`, `CategoryPills`, `FestivalEdit`, `OurStory` components) was retired; that Paper design no longer exists. `/shop`'s content (hero carousel, flash sale bar, occasion/new-arrivals sections, filter sidebar + product grid) now lives at `app/store/page.tsx` (the `/` route) instead of a separate `/shop` path — there is no `/shop` route left in the app, and nothing redirects to one. Category SEO pages move to `/category/[categorySlug]` (not `/shop/[categorySlug]`) — namespaced to avoid a category slug colliding with a static top-level route like `/about` or `/cart`.
- **Header nav wired to real filters, not `href="#"`:** Desktop `StoreHeader` nav (`components/store/store-header.tsx`) now links Festive → `/?occasion=Festive` and New Arrivals → `/?sort=newest`, both read by the home page via `useSearchParams` on mount. "Shop" was dropped from the nav (Home now serves that role — a self-referencing link would be redundant). Women/Men currently link home unfiltered — there's no gender field on `products` yet, so real filtering for those two is deferred until the schema supports it.
- **Local dev preview without subdomain middleware:** No subdomain-resolution middleware exists yet (§3.1's wildcard routing was never implemented — confirmed no `middleware.ts` in the repo). `lib/data/tenant.ts` now exports `getDevTenantId()`, a dev-only (`NODE_ENV === 'development'`) fallback that resolves a seeded tenant by slug (`TALAM_DEV_TENANT_SLUG`, default `silk`) when `x-tenant-id` is absent, so `app/store/layout.tsx` renders locally at `localhost:3000/store` without simulating a subdomain. This is a stopgap, not a substitute for the real middleware §3.1 still requires before production launch.

**Changelog v1.4 (2026-07-04)**
- **OTP stays SMS-only, DLT fee now budgeted:** Considered switching Phone OTP delivery to WhatsApp (via Supabase + Twilio) to dodge MSG91's ₹5,900 one-time DLT Principal Entity registration fee. Confirmed the fee is a TRAI regulatory requirement that applies to *any* SMS gateway sending OTPs to Indian numbers (Twilio, Fast2SMS, 2Factor, etc. all require it) — switching providers doesn't avoid it. Also, ~25% of Indian smartphone users don't have WhatsApp, so it can't be the sole phone-based login channel without a fallback. **Decision: keep §5 Phone OTP as SMS-only via MSG91, treat the ₹5,900 DLT fee as a one-time setup cost** (in addition to the ₹1,890/mo recurring infra cost in §4).
- **WhatsApp scoped to alerts, not auth:** The "(V1.5) MSG91 WhatsApp: order alert to store owner" line in §3.4 is now a defined flow: before sending, run a WhatsApp Business API contact-check on the number; if the number isn't on WhatsApp, **fall back to email (Resend)** — not SMS. SMS-as-alert-fallback is deferred to V2 (see §12) since it adds per-message cost the email fallback avoids. Because MSG91 offers both SMS and WhatsApp Business API under one account, no second vendor is needed for this.

**Changelog v1.3 (2026-07-04)**
- **`/auth` finalized in Paper:** Single unified screen serves both login and signup — mobile number field (+91 prefix) → "Continue" → OTP (OTP-entry step not yet designed) → session, with "Continue with Google" as a secondary option below a divider. No separate signup screen exists; the OTP flow doesn't distinguish new vs. returning users until the number is verified, so one screen covers both. Email/password (§5 priority 3) remains unbuilt in the UI — Phone OTP and Google are the only two options designed so far.
- **`/account` header entry point defined:** Clicking the profile icon in the storefront header opens an `Account Menu` dropdown. Logged-out: single "Log in / Sign up" row → `/auth`. Logged-in: profile icon becomes an initial avatar; dropdown shows name + phone, then Profile / Settings / Log Out (Log Out styled in the danger colour). This is the header-level entry point that complements the full `/account` page.
- **Settings folded into `/account` (decided 2026-07-04):** no separate `/account/settings` route. "Settings" in the Account Menu deep-links to a settings section within the same `/account` page (Paper already designs it this way — the `Account & Settings — Mobile` / `Settings — Desktop` artboards are one combined page, not two).
- **Storefront `/about` desktop parity:** `/about` now has a designed desktop layout (two-column: profile/stats + story/branches), matching the rest of the desktop storefront. Previously mobile-only.
- **`/wishlist` desktop parity:** Desktop wishlist now includes the same filter controls (In Stock / Price / On Sale) and a Share action that were previously mobile-only.
- **Product detail delivery estimate cut:** The pincode "Check Delivery Date" widget on `/product/[slug]` (distinct from the `/checkout` pincode auto-fill in §3.2, which is unaffected) was removed from the mobile design — it was never built for desktop, so the two are now aligned. If delivery-estimate-on-PDP is still wanted, it needs to be re-scoped and re-designed, not just re-added as-is.
- See `docs/design/2026-06-23-talam-oss-design.md` §4.1b for full Account Menu / Auth design detail, and `docs/2026-06-28-PAPER-DESIGN-INVENTORY.md` for per-screen build status.

**Changelog v1.2 (2026-06-30)**
- **Admin nav restructure:** Customers promoted from a Settings sub-route to a top-level nav item. Bottom nav (mobile) is now 5 items: Dashboard, Orders, Products, Customers, Settings — not 4. Desktop drops the top header nav in favor of a fixed left sidebar (icon-only, expandable), with Settings subsections nested under it. See `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-27-admin-dashboard-design.md` for full spec.
- **Trial banner:** Removed from the admin dashboard UI spec (the read-only-on-expiry *behavior* in §2 is unchanged — only the dashboard banner component was cut).
- **Settings hub:** Now 12 routes nested under Settings (Customers moved out; see above).

**Changelog v1.1 Final (2026-06-25)**
- **Domain:** Changed from `talam.app` (unavailable) to `talam4shop.com`
- **Product categories:** Added `product_categories` table — dynamic, per-tenant, ordered categories
- **Store identity:** Added `/about` storefront route + `/admin/about` admin route for store story, social links, branch locations
- **Product reviews:** Added 5-star review system with verified purchase badges, moderation, and report mechanism. New tables: `product_reviews`, `review_reports`
- **Delivery & trust:** Added trust badges (free delivery, return window, custom trust text), pincode delivery check, size guide upload
- **Admin restructure:** Settings becomes a hub with sub-navigation (13 routes nested under Settings). Bottom nav reduced to 4 items: Dashboard, Products, Orders, Settings
- **Onboarding:** Reduced to 5 steps (Store → Brand → Product → Payment → Go Live), with categories moved to post-onboarding `/admin/categories`
- **Database:** Added 4 new tables (store_about, store_branches, product_reviews, review_reports) + 13 new columns on tenants table
- **Payment providers:** Confirmed V1 scope = UPI Manual + Instamojo + Razorpay only (PhonePe moved to V2)
- **GTM:** Expanded ICP definition, referral attribution, email nurture sequences, pricing page
- **Timeline:** Adjusted to 9 weeks (accounts for reviews, about page, delivery/trust features)

## 3. Architecture

### 3.1 Multi-Tenancy Model
- **Routing:** Wildcard subdomain `*.talam4shop.com` — Vercel middleware extracts subdomain → resolves `tenant_id` → injects into request context via `x-tenant-id` / `x-tenant-tier` headers
- **Database:** Shared PostgreSQL, every table has `tenant_id` UUID foreign key
- **Isolation:** Supabase Row Level Security (RLS) enforces tenant boundaries at DB level; Prisma `withTenant()` sets `app.tenant_id` session variable before every query
- **Image isolation:** Cloudinary folder per tenant `/talam/{tenantId}/`
- **Admin split:** Tenant admin at `{store}.talam4shop.com/admin`, Super admin at `admin.talam4shop.com`

### 3.2 App Structure

```
talam4shop.com/                       → Marketing landing page + pricing page
{store}.talam4shop.com/               → Tenant storefront
{store}.talam4shop.com/admin          → Tenant admin panel
admin.talam4shop.com/                 → Super admin (platform owner)
```

**Storefront routes:**
```
/                         Home — IS the product listing (hero carousel, flash sale, filters/sort, grid).
                          No separate hero/collections home design — the old home was retired (v1.5)
                          and /shop was merged into / instead of / redirecting to /shop.
/about                    Store about page — owner story, social links, trust stats, branch locations
/category/[categorySlug]  Category-specific listing — SEO-indexable, pre-rendered (ISR 30 min).
                          Namespaced under /category (not bare /[slug]) to avoid a category named
                          e.g. "about" or "cart" colliding with the static top-level routes below.
/product/[slug]           Product detail — images, size picker, reviews, trust badges, add to cart
/cart                     Shopping cart (Zustand + localStorage)
/checkout                 Address + payment gateway (pincode auto-fill, delivery estimate)
/orders                   Order history + tracking
/orders/[id]              Single order detail + status
/wishlist                 Saved products
/account                  Settings — Addresses, Payment Methods, Notifications (accordion sections) + Log Out / Delete Account.
                          Renamed "Settings" in the mobile bottom nav and Account Menu (was "Account" through v1.5).
/account/profile          Edit Profile — full name, email (editable), phone number (read-only). Reached only from
                          the Account Menu's "Profile" row, not from the Settings page itself (v1.6, see changelog).
/auth                     OTP / Google / Email login
```

**Tenant admin routes:**
```
/admin/dashboard     Sales stats (Revenue, Orders, Customers, Avg Order Value), notifications bell; desktop sidebar nav label: "Overview"
/admin/products      Add / edit / delete products, low stock badges
/admin/orders        Order list, status updates, tracking ID entry, search filter
/admin/customers     Customer list, contact details, order history per customer (top-level nav item — not under Settings)
/admin/settings      Hub page linking to:
  ├── /admin/settings/store       Store name, tagline, contact phone/email
  ├── /admin/settings/brand       Logo, primary color
  ├── /admin/settings/payment     Payment gateway config
  ├── /admin/settings/whatsapp    Phone, toggle button visibility
  ├── /admin/settings/delivery    Free delivery above, shipping fee, delivery estimate, return window, trust badges, size guide
  ├── /admin/settings/notifications  Email & order alerts
  ├── /admin/about                Store story, social links, branch locations
  ├── /admin/reviews              Product reviews moderation (all + reported)
  ├── /admin/categories           Create / reorder / delete product categories
  ├── /admin/promotions           Discount codes, sale banners
  ├── /admin/payouts              Settlement history from payment gateway
  ├── /admin/billing              Subscription plan, upgrade, payment history
  └── Danger Zone                 Delete store (soft-delete)
/admin/onboarding    First-run setup wizard (5 steps: Store → Brand → Product → Payment → Go Live)

Mobile bottom nav (5 items): Dashboard, Products, Orders, Customers, Settings.
Desktop: fixed left sidebar nav (icon-only, expandable), not a top header nav — see `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-27-admin-dashboard-design.md`.
```

**Super admin routes:**
```
/dashboard           Platform metrics — GMV, active stores, MRR
/tenants             All stores — tier, status, last order date
/tenants/[id]        Individual store details, tier override
/billing             Subscription payments, failed renewals
```

**Marketing site routes:**
```
talam4shop.com/         Landing page — hero, features, social proof
talam4shop.com/pricing  Plan comparison — Trial / Starter / Pro feature table + CTA
talam4shop.com/join     Referral landing page — captures utm_campaign={slug} for attribution
```

### 3.3 Rendering Strategy

| Page | Strategy | Revalidation |
|---|---|---|
| Storefront home | ISR | 1 hour |
| `/about` | ISR | 1 hour (on-demand on admin save) |
| Shop / filters | ISR | 30 minutes |
| Shop / [categorySlug] | ISR + generateStaticParams | 30 minutes |
| Product detail | ISR + on-demand | On admin product edit OR new review via `/api/revalidate` |
| Cart | Client (Zustand) | — |
| Checkout | SSR dynamic | Every request |
| Orders | SSR dynamic | Every request |
| Admin all pages | SSR dynamic | Every request |
| Marketing (pricing, join) | Static | On deploy |

### 3.4 Post-Checkout Flow (Non-blocking)

```
Payment webhook received → verify signature → mark order PAID
→ Vercel after() fires:
    ├── Resend: order confirmation email to customer
    ├── Resend: "New order ₹X from {name}" to store owner (fetched via Supabase admin)
    ├── PostHog: order_paid event tracked (user_id, tenant_id, amount — no PII)
    └── (V1.5) WhatsApp order alert to store owner via MSG91 WhatsApp Business API
        — contact-check first; if number isn't on WhatsApp, fall back to Resend email (not SMS — see §12)
```

**Total infra cost before first tenant: ₹1,890/mo**

**Dev vs. production DB:** The current Supabase project (`egxsukuswespiicezxoz`) is a **dev/QA instance only**. A separate Supabase project — with its own `DATABASE_URL` / `DATABASE_URL_SERVICE_ROLE` and Prisma migrations replayed fresh — must be provisioned for production once testing & QA are complete, ahead of the Week 9 go-live (see §11 Timeline). Do not point production traffic at the dev project ref.

---

## 5. Authentication

**Providers (in priority order):**
1. **Phone OTP** — primary, matches Myntra/Flipkart UX, via Supabase Auth + SMS Hook + MSG91. **SMS only** — WhatsApp is not used as a login channel (see Changelog v1.4); the ₹5,900 one-time MSG91 DLT registration fee is a required regulatory cost, not MSG91-specific.
2. **Google Sign-In** — one-tap alternative
3. **Email + Password** — fallback

**OTP flow:**
```
User enters phone → rate limit check (Upstash Redis: 5/10 min per phone)
→ Supabase Auth generates OTP
→ SMS Hook fires → Supabase Edge Function (msg91-sms-hook)
→ MSG91 API delivers OTP to phone (₹0.12)
→ User enters OTP → Supabase verifies
→ JWT issued → RLS identity bound → session created
```

**Session management:** Supabase Auth handles JWT issuance, refresh, and expiry. HttpOnly cookies via `@supabase/ssr`. Session refreshed on every request in middleware.

## 7. Payment Architecture

### Payment Provider Abstraction
```typescript
interface PaymentProvider {
  name: string
  createOrder(amount: number, orderId: string): Promise<{ checkoutData: CheckoutData }>
  verifyWebhook(payload: unknown, headers: Headers): Promise<WebhookVerifyResult>
}

type CheckoutData = {
  paymentUrl?: string      // UPI deep link or Instamojo redirect URL
  qrCode?: string          // UPI QR code image URL
}

// V1 Implementations
class UpiManualProvider implements PaymentProvider { ... }
class InstamojoProvider implements PaymentProvider { ... }
class RazorpayProvider implements PaymentProvider { ... }

// V2+
class PhonePeProvider implements PaymentProvider { ... }  // V2
```

### Payment Options for Tenants (V1)

| Provider | KYC Required | Fee | Best For |
|---|---|---|---|
| UPI Manual | UPI ID only | 0% | Anyone, manual confirm |
| Instamojo ← Recommended | PAN + savings account | 2% + ₹3 | Individual sellers |
| Razorpay | Existing account | 2% | Already registered businesses |

**V2 additions:** PhonePe (0% UPI, ~2% cards) — requires current account

### Money Flow
```
Customer pays → tenant's payment gateway account
→ Money direct to tenant's bank (T+2 or instant for UPI)
→ Talam never touches transaction money
→ Talam charges subscription separately via own Razorpay
```

**Razorpay Route (V2):** Once Talam has 50+ stores and qualifies for FLDG, migrate to central collection with automated platform fee deduction.

## 8. Security

### Critical Controls (Blockers — must implement first)

**1. Prisma non-superuser role:**
```sql
CREATE ROLE talam_app_user WITH LOGIN PASSWORD '...';
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO talam_app_user;
```
```typescript
// withTenant() injects tenant context before every query
await prisma.$executeRaw`SELECT set_config('app.tenant_id', ${tenantId}, true)`
```

**2. Supabase client split:**
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY    → browser/client components (safe)
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY        → server-only, never NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix
```
ESLint rule blocks accidental `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix on any secret key.

**3. MSG91 via SMS Hook (not direct):**
Supabase generates OTP → SMS Hook → Edge Function → MSG91 API → customer phone.
Supabase session management unbroken. Hook signature verified with HMAC-SHA256.

### Additional Security
- All Server Actions verify Supabase session before any DB mutation
- Admin routes verify `tenant.owner_id === auth.uid()`
- Super admin routes verify `user.app_metadata.role === 'super_admin'`
- Webhook endpoints verify provider signature before any order status update
- Rate limiting on OTP endpoint: 5 attempts per phone per 10 min (Upstash Redis)
- Payment gateway keys stored in `tenant.payment_config` JSONB (encrypted at rest by Supabase)
- Security headers on all responses via middleware: `X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options`, `Referrer-Policy`

## 9. Infrastructure

### DNS Setup
```
Domain registrar: Cloudflare (at-cost pricing, no markup)
Domain: talam4shop.com
Nameservers: ns1.vercel-dns.com + ns2.vercel-dns.com (required for wildcard SSL)
Vercel project: Add talam4shop.com + *.talam4shop.com wildcard domain
Email subdomain: mail.talam4shop.com (Resend SPF/DKIM DNS records added via Vercel DNS)
SSL: Auto-provisioned by Vercel via Let's Encrypt (wildcard cert requires Vercel nameservers)
```

## 10. GTM Strategy

### Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)

**Primary ICP — V1 focus:**
Women-owned ethnic wear, handicrafts, or homemade food businesses in Tier 1–2 Indian cities. Selling today via Instagram DMs and WhatsApp forwards. No website. 0–3 years old. 20–200 orders/month at ₹500–₹5,000 AOV. Phone-first: browses Instagram on phone, manages orders on WhatsApp at night.

**Why this ICP first:** D'Mystique is this exact profile. The first 5 referrals target the same category — not bakeries or salons (different UX needs, lower price tolerance). Once ethnic wear is proven, adjacent categories are fast follows.

**ICP captured at onboarding:** Wizard step 1 asks "What kind of products do you sell?" → maps to `tenant.store_type` → drives PostHog segmentation (`store_type` property on all events).

### GTM Motion

| | |
|---|---|
| **Primary motion** | Community-led — WhatsApp forwards + Instagram Reels |
| **Store #1** | D'Mystique live → real order screenshots → WhatsApp forward to peer sellers |
| **Viral loop** | "Powered by Talam" badge → `/join?utm_campaign={slug}` → signup → referrer gets 1 free month |
| **WhatsApp preview** | `@vercel/og` generates 1200×630 card when store link shared — brand color + product image |
| **Paid (Month 2)** | Instagram Reels ads, ₹5–10K/mo, Tamil Nadu women business owners 25–45 |
| **SEO** | Per-tenant category pages (`silk.talam4shop.com/category/sarees`) — indexable, shareable URLs |
| **Pricing page** | `talam4shop.com/pricing` — public plan comparison with "Start free" CTA, no credit card required |

### Referral Attribution
- "Powered by Talam" badge on trial stores links to `talam4shop.com/join?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=store&utm_campaign={slug}`
- `/join` page reads `utm_campaign`, shows: *"You found us via {store name}. They get 1 free month when you subscribe."*
- On successful subscription, referrer's `trial_ends_at` extended by 30 days (super admin action or Razorpay webhook)

### Owner Email Nurture Sequence (Resend)
Triggered by Vercel Cron — checks tenant state daily:

| Trigger | Delay | Email |
|---|---|---|
| Tenant created | Day 0 | "Welcome to Talam — add your first product in 5 minutes" |
| No products added | Day 2 | "Need a hand? Here's how to set up your store" |
| Products added, no orders | Day 7 | "Your store is live — share this link to get your first order" |
| Trial ends in 1 day | Day 13 | "Your trial ends tomorrow — subscribe to keep selling" |
| Trial expired, not subscribed | Day 15 | "Your store is paused — reactivate in 1 click" |

### Targets

| Metric | Month 1 | Month 3 |
|---|---|---|
| Paying stores | 5 | 25 |
| MRR | ₹2,495 | ₹12,475 |
| Active stores (≥1 order/30d) | 4 | 20 |

**North Star Metric:** Active stores with ≥1 order in last 30 days.

## 11. Timeline

| Week | Focus |
|---|---|
| 1 | Project init, Supabase setup, Prisma schema (incl. `product_categories`, `store_about`, `store_branches`, `product_reviews`, `review_reports`), auth flow (OTP + Google) |

| 3 | Cart, checkout (with pincode auto-fill + delivery estimate), payment gateway integration (UPI Manual + Instamojo + Razorpay) |
| 4 | Orders, account, wishlist, `/about` storefront page with trust stats + branches |
| 5 | Tenant admin — dashboard (notifications, trends), products CRUD, orders management, customers tab, categories CRUD |
| 6 | Admin settings hub (Store Details, Brand, Payment, WhatsApp, Delivery & Trust, Notifications, Danger Zone), `/admin/about` (story, social, branches), `/admin/reviews` moderation |
| 7 | Onboarding wizard (5 steps: Store → Brand → Product → Payment → Go Live), trust badges, size guide, review reporting, OG cards |
| 8 | Super admin, PostHog analytics, Resend emails + nurture sequences, rate limiting |
| 9 | D'Mystique goes live as Store #1, QA, Lighthouse performance audit, security headers, go-live |

## 12. Open Questions / V2 Backlog

**V2 Features:**
- **Payment:** PhonePe PG integration (0% UPI, ~2% cards), Razorpay Route for automated platform fee deduction (requires 50+ stores for FLDG)
- **Reviews:** Review response by store owner, review helpfulness voting ("Was this helpful?")
- **Store:** Tamil language UI toggle, referral dashboard for store owners (track how many stores they've referred)
- **Inventory:** Drag-to-reorder categories in admin (sort_order already in schema — just needs UI), multi-image upload with drag-drop reorder on product form, returned stock restoration (prompt to restock when order marked Returned)
- **Logistics:** COD (cash on delivery) support, international shipping / currency, real-time courier serviceability check
- **Admin:** PostHog analytics dashboard page (`/admin/analytics` — beyond dashboard stat cards), GST-compliant invoice PDF generation for registered sellers
- **Integrations:** SMS fallback for owner/customer alerts when WhatsApp contact-check fails (V1 fallback is email-only, see §3.4/§4/Changelog v1.4), Vyapar CSV export for accounting sync, custom domain per Pro tenant (Vercel Domains API)

**Resolved questions (moved from backlog):**
- ~~Domain `talam.app`~~ → **`talam4shop.com`** (registered) — v1.1
- ~~Free-text category field~~ → **`product_categories` FK table** (v1.1)
- ~~No referral tracking~~ → **UTM + `/join` page** (v1.1)
- ~~No social proof / reviews~~ → **Product reviews + verified purchase badges** (v1.1)
- ~~No store identity~~ → **Store About page + owner photo + social links + branch locations** (v1.1)
- ~~No delivery/trust signals~~ → **Trust badges + delivery estimate + return window** (v1.1)
