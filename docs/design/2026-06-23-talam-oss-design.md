# Talam — Open Source Design Spec

**Date:** 2026-06-23
**Last updated:** 2026-06-30
**Status:** Open for Contribution
**Version:** 1.2 (design tokens + component reality synced to live Paper file)
**For:** UI/UX designers contributing to the Talam open source project

> **Design source of truth:** Real design work now happens in a Paper Design file (`Talam Design`, 67 artboards across 5 pages). This document's brand/typography/spacing/radius tokens (§2) and the design tokens reference (§10) have been re-synced to that file's live token set as of 2026-06-30. Sections 4.1–4.14 (page-by-page layout specs) are the original written brief and have **not** been individually re-verified against each Paper artboard this pass — treat them as design intent, not a guaranteed pixel match. For current per-screen build status, see [`docs/2026-06-28-PAPER-DESIGN-INVENTORY.md`](../2026-06-28-PAPER-DESIGN-INVENTORY.md).

**Changelog v1.2 (2026-06-30)**
- Colour, typography, spacing, and border-radius tokens (§2) replaced with the actual token set exported from the live Paper file (single unified `--color-*` namespace, not split admin/storefront blocks)
- §10 Design Tokens reference rewritten to use the real token names/values from Paper instead of placeholder semantic names
- `TrialBanner` component removed from §3 — trial banner was cut from the admin dashboard spec
- Admin bottom navigation corrected from 4 items to 5 (`Dashboard, Products, Orders, Customers, Settings`) — confirmed live in both mobile and desktop Admin Dashboard artboards
- Onboarding wizard step count corrected from "6-step" to 5-step in §3 (the wizard itself, §4.7, was already correct)

**Changelog v1.1 (2026-06-25)**
- Domain updated: `talam.app` → `mytalam.com` throughout
- Added `/shop/[categorySlug]` SEO route to storefront section
- Added `mytalam.com/pricing` and `mytalam.com/join` to marketing site scope
- **NEW:** Storefront `/about` page — store story, owner photo, social links, trust stats, branch locations
- **NEW:** Storefront `/wishlist` page design specs
- **NEW:** Product reviews UI — individual review cards, verified purchase badges, review filtering, report mechanism
- **NEW:** Admin `/admin/about` page — store story editor, social links, branch CRUD
- **NEW:** Admin `/admin/reviews` page — moderation dashboard (all reviews + reported reviews tabs)
- **NEW:** Product categories in home and shop filters (dynamic, owner-defined, reorderable)
- **NEW:** Trust badges on product detail (free delivery, return window, custom trust text)

## Welcome, Designer

Talam is an open-source multi-tenant e-commerce SaaS platform built for Indian small businesses. We are looking for design contributions across two surfaces:

1. **Storefront** — what customers see when they visit a store (e.g. `silk.mytalam.com`)
2. **Tenant Admin Panel** — what store owners use to manage products, orders, and settings (mobile-first)

This document gives you everything you need to contribute designs without writing code.

---

## 1. Design Philosophy

### Core Principles

**1. Mobile-first, always**
Over 80% of customers arrive via a WhatsApp link on a phone. Every screen is designed for a 390px viewport first, then expanded for desktop. If it doesn't work on mobile, it doesn't ship.

**2. Myntra-quality, boutique-soul**
The reference UX is Myntra — clean product photography, smooth transitions, confident typography. But the personality is warm and local, not corporate. Think of it as Myntra if it were built by someone in Chennai for someone in Chennai.

**3. Non-technical store owners**
The admin panel is used by people who manage their business from a phone at 10pm. Every action must be obvious in under 3 seconds. No jargon, no settings menus with 20 options, no tooltips that explain tooltips.

**4. Trust through simplicity**
Customers need to feel safe paying a boutique they discovered via WhatsApp. Clean design, clear order confirmation, visible brand identity, and a professional checkout all build that trust. Avoid anything that looks "free website builder."

**5. Tamil soul, universal appeal**
Talam is Tamil-rooted but designed for any Indian small business. Avoid regional clichés. Use warmth, colour, and craft — not temple motifs or classical illustrations unless the store owner has chosen them.

---

## 2. Brand Identity (Talam Platform)

### Logo Concept
The Talam wordmark uses the concept of a solid ground — the platform that businesses stand on. Clean, modern, no decorative elements.

- **Primary wordmark:** "talam" in lowercase, geometric sans-serif
- **Icon mark:** A simple square with a subtle upward step — represents elevation/platform
- **Colour pairing:** Deep indigo + warm amber

### Colour System

> **Source:** live token set exported from the Paper design file, Design Library page (44 tokens total, content hash `42f27fdd` as of 2026-06-30). Talam uses one unified token namespace for both Admin and Storefront — not separate colour systems — with `--color-store-primary` as the one themable-per-tenant value.

```css
--color-fg:              #18181B   /* Foreground text */
--color-muted:            #8B7D7A  /* Secondary text (warm muted, not cool gray) */
--color-border:           #E8E8E8  /* Default borders, dividers */
--color-border-light:     #F0F0F0  /* Lighter dividers */
--color-surface:          #FFFFFF  /* Cards, panels */
--color-bg:               #F9F9F9  /* Page background */
--color-bg-dark:          #1A1A1A  /* Dark sections (hero, about) */
--color-store-primary:    #E8577E  /* Themable per tenant — example value shown */
--color-amber:            #F59E0B  /* Accent, warmth */
--color-danger:           #EF4444  /* Destructive, errors */
--color-success:          #10B981  /* Positive actions */
--color-success-bg:       #F0FDF4  /* Success banner background */
--color-success-border:   #BBEDD4  /* Success banner border */
--color-brand-primary:    #4F3FF0  /* Talam platform indigo */
```

**Store theming:** Each store owner sets `--color-store-primary` during onboarding. This colour drives all primary actions (buttons, links, badges, active states). The live design file uses `#E8577E` (pink) as its example — earlier drafts of this spec used `#C2185B` (rose); either is a valid example value, the token is what matters.

**Not yet tokenized but used in copy/spec text below:** `--wa` (#25D366, WhatsApp brand colour) and `--sale`/`--new` badge colours are referenced throughout §4 but don't have dedicated Paper tokens yet — they currently reuse `--color-danger` and `--color-success`.

### Typography

> **Source:** live Paper token set. Font sizes, weights, tracking, and line-heights below are exact `--text-*` / `--font-weight-*` / `--tracking-*` / `--leading-*` tokens — not approximations.

```css
--font-heading: "Playfair Display", system-ui, serif        /* Storefront headings — elegant, ethnic */
--font-body:    "DM Sans", system-ui, sans-serif             /* Storefront body — clean, readable */
--font-admin:   system-ui, sans-serif                        /* Admin panel UI */
```

Fonts loaded in the design file: System Sans-Serif, Playfair Display, DM Sans, System Monospace.

**Font sizes (`--text-*` tokens, px):**
```
--text-2xs:  11px   /* Smallest captions */
--text-xs:   12px   /* Labels, badges, captions */
--text-sm:   13px   /* Button text, filter labels */
--text-md:   14px   /* Body text, small descriptions */
--text-base: 16px   /* Body text default, section headings */
--text-lg:   18px   /* Page titles on mobile */
--text-xl:   20px   /* Product names, large headings */
--text-2xl:  28px   /* Hero / modal titles */
```
*(Earlier drafts of this spec used a 9-step scale including 15px/24px/26px — the live token set above is the 8-step scale actually in use; if you need an in-between size, check with the design file before introducing a new raw value.)*

**Font weights:**
```
--font-weight-normal:   400
--font-weight-medium:   500
--font-weight-semibold: 600
--font-weight-bold:     700
```

**Letter spacing:**
```
--tracking-normal: 0em
--tracking-wide:   0.08em   /* Uppercase labels, eyebrow text */
```

**Line heights (`--leading-*`, px):**
```
--leading-tight:   16px   /* Headings, product names */
--leading-snug:    18px   /* Labels, captions */
--leading-normal:  22px   /* Body text default */
--leading-relaxed: 24px   /* Readable body, descriptions */
--leading-loose:   34px   /* Hero titles */
```

### Spacing System (4px base)

`--spacing-*` tokens from the live Paper file:

```
--spacing-1:  4px
--spacing-2:  8px
--spacing-3:  12px
--spacing-4:  16px   /* Main padding (mobile), form fields */
--spacing-5:  20px   /* Section padding */
--spacing-6:  24px   /* Spacing between major sections */
--spacing-8:  32px   /* Large section gaps, hero padding */
--spacing-10: 40px   /* Hero padding on desktop */
```
*(Earlier drafts also listed 6px/10px/14px as named steps — those aren't tokens in the live file; they may still appear as one-off raw values in specific components, but new work should snap to the 8-step scale above.)*

### Border Radius

`--radius-*` tokens from the live Paper file:

```
--radius-sm:   4px    /* Minimal, small interactive elements */
--radius-md:   6px    /* Compact form controls, tight buttons */
--radius-lg:   8px    /* Standard cards, buttons, inputs */
--radius-xl:   10px   /* Order/product cards */
--radius-full: 999px  /* Pills (filters, badges), avatars */
```
*(Earlier drafts also listed 12px/16px/20px steps for modals and filter sheets — those aren't tokens in the live file either; larger containers currently use raw values rather than a dedicated token. Worth raising with whoever owns the Paper file if that's intentional or a gap.)*

---

## 3. Component Library

Components are built with vanilla HTML/CSS (no framework dependency). Use CSS Grid, Flexbox, and CSS custom properties for theming. Designers should reference component implementations in the prototype files for exact specifications.

> The live Paper file has a dedicated **Design Library** page with 7 component groups: Buttons & Badges, Design System (reference sheet), Navigation, Cards, Checkout Components, Storefront Sections, Admin Components. The table below is the original, more granular component brief — it has not been checked component-by-component against those 7 groups this pass, so treat it as the spec, not a confirmed inventory of what's built.

## 5. Mobile-First Constraints

| Constraint | Value |
|---|---|
| Min viewport | 375px |
| Target viewport | 390px (iPhone 14) |
| Touch targets | Min 44×44px |
| Font minimum | 14px body, 12px labels |
| Bottom nav clearance | 80px (iOS home indicator) |
| Max content width | 480px on mobile, 1200px on desktop |
| Tap feedback | Scale 0.97 on active state |

**Bottom navigation (storefront, mobile only):**
```
[Home] [Shop] [Wishlist] [Orders] [Account]
```

**Admin bottom navigation (mobile only):**
```
[Dashboard] [Products] [Orders] [Customers] [Settings]
```
*(Confirmed live in the Paper file 2026-06-30 — 5 items, not 4. Desktop is meant to use a left sidebar nav per the [Admin Dashboard Revision](../2026-06-28-ADMIN-DASHBOARD-REVISION.md), but the live desktop artboard still reads as a top header with horizontal nav buttons — unresolved, see the Inventory doc.)*

---

## 6. Accessibility Requirements

- All interactive elements: min 44×44px touch target
- Colour contrast: WCAG AA minimum (4.5:1 text, 3:1 UI)
- All images: descriptive alt text
- Form inputs: visible labels (not placeholder-only)
- Error states: text + colour (never colour alone)
- Focus indicators: visible on keyboard navigation
- Loading states: skeleton screens (not spinners where possible)
- Success/error: Toast notification + accessible `role="status"`

---

## 7. Motion & Animation

| Interaction | Animation | Duration |
|---|---|---|
| Page transition | Fade + slight Y translate | 200ms ease |
| Cart drawer open | Slide from right | 250ms ease-out |
| Filter drawer open | Slide from bottom | 300ms ease-out |
| Product card hover | Scale 1.02 (desktop only) | 150ms |
| Add to cart | Button pulse + cart icon bounce | 300ms |
| Onboarding step change | Slide left/right | 200ms ease |
| Toast notification | Slide from top | 250ms spring |
| Confetti (go live) | Burst animation | 1500ms |

**Reduce motion:** Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` — all animations fall back to instant or simple fade.

---

## 8. Empty States

Every list/grid must have a designed empty state:

| Screen | Empty State |
|---|---|
| Shop (no products) | Illustration + "No products yet" + "Check back soon" |
| Orders (no orders) | Illustration + "No orders yet" + "Share your store" link |
| Wishlist (empty) | Heart illustration + "Save items you love" |
| Admin products (none) | Illustration + "Add your first product" CTA button |
| Admin orders (none) | Illustration + "Share your store to get your first order" |
| Search (no results) | "No results for '{query}'" + "Try different keywords" |

## 9. Design File Contribution Guidelines

### Preferred Tools
- **Figma** (primary — use auto-layout, components, variables)
- **Penpot** (open source alternative — fully accepted)

### File Structure

```

### Naming Convention
- Frames: `[Section] / [Page] / [State]` → e.g. `Storefront / Product Detail / Out of Stock`
- Components: PascalCase → `ProductCard`, `SizeSelector`, `OrderStatusBadge`
- Variants: descriptive → `size=M, state=selected, stock=available`

### What to Submit
- Figma share link (view access) via GitHub issue
- OR exported SVG/PNG frames for review
- Include mobile + desktop frames for each page
- Note which components are new vs extended from shadcn/ui

### How to Contribute
1. Open a GitHub issue: `[Design] Page/Component Name`
2. Tag it: `design`, `good first issue` (for single components) or `design:feature` (for full pages)
3. Share your Figma link or attach design files
4. A maintainer reviews and provides feedback within 48 hours

## 10. Design Tokens (CSS Variables Reference)

Designers: these are the **exact token names from the live Paper file** (44 tokens, content hash `42f27fdd`, verified 2026-06-30) — not placeholder names. There is no app codebase yet (no `app/` directory exists in this repo), so Paper is the only canonical source for these until a Tailwind/CSS export happens. Use these exact names in your annotations.

```css
/* Colour */
--color-fg               /* #18181B */
--color-muted            /* #8B7D7A */
--color-border           /* #E8E8E8 */
--color-border-light     /* #F0F0F0 */
--color-surface          /* #FFFFFF */
--color-bg                /* #F9F9F9 */
--color-bg-dark           /* #1A1A1A */
--color-store-primary    /* Themable per tenant — example #E8577E */
--color-amber             /* #F59E0B */
--color-danger            /* #EF4444 */
--color-success           /* #10B981 */
--color-success-bg        /* #F0FDF4 */
--color-success-border    /* #BBEDD4 */
--color-brand-primary    /* #4F3FF0 — Talam platform indigo */

/* Typography */
--font-heading            /* "Playfair Display", system-ui, serif */
--font-body                /* "DM Sans", system-ui, sans-serif */
--font-admin               /* system-ui, sans-serif */
--text-2xs … --text-2xl   /* 11px – 28px, 8-step scale, see §2 */
--font-weight-normal … --font-weight-bold   /* 400 / 500 / 600 / 700 */
--tracking-normal / --tracking-wide          /* 0em / 0.08em */
--leading-tight … --leading-loose            /* 16px – 34px, 5-step scale */

/* Spacing */
--spacing-1 … --spacing-10   /* 4px – 40px, 8-step scale, see §2 */

/* Radius */
--radius-sm … --radius-full  /* 4px – 999px, see §2 */
```

**Not yet tokenized — referenced in §4 as raw values, confirm before relying on a token name for these:**
```css
--header-height         /* 60px mobile, 72px desktop */
--bottom-nav-height     /* 64px mobile only */
--content-max-width     /* 1200px */
--sidebar-width         /* 280px (admin desktop, expanded state) */
```

## 11. What We Need Most (Priority Order)

1. **Storefront — Product Detail page** (highest conversion impact)
2. **Tenant Admin — Mobile dashboard** (most used by store owners)
3. **Onboarding wizard** (first experience — sets expectations)
4. **Checkout flow** (trust = conversion)
5. **mytalam.com marketing site** — landing page, `/pricing` plan comparison, `/join` referral page (acquisition)
6. **Empty states** (polish, delight)
7. **Illustration set** (empty states, onboarding, success screens)
